# New Relic VMware vSphere integration

New Relic's VMware vSphere integration captures critical summary and performance metrics data by connecting to VMware vCenter or an ESXi Host. For more information, see [the official New Relic docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration).

The integration collects data about data centers, clusters, virtual machines, hosts, datastores, resource pools, and networks. In addition to metrics, the integration can also capture vSphere events and VM snapshot information when enabled by the appropriate flags.

## Requirements

- [New Relic infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure)

## Installation

To install the integration, follow the official [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration). We recommend using your operating system's package manager.

## Getting started

After you've [installed](#installation) the integration make sure that you have the required configuration for your environment.

To configure the integration go to `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/` (Linux) or `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\` (Windows) and open the`vpshere-config.yml` configuration file.

Configure the `URL`, `user`, and `password` fields -- they are required to connect to your vCenter or ESXi host.

To select which performance metrics to capture, you must define them in the `vsphere-performance.metrics` file per each `performance level` you require.
You can find this file in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/vsphere-performance.metrics` (Linux) or `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\vsphere-performance.metrics` (Windows).
Use the flag `--perf_level` to select which level of **performance metrics** you want to capture.

Please note that the more performance metrics you enable the more load you add to your environment.

Notice that the integration fetches multiple values for a single performance metrics related to different "instances" 
belonging to a single object, but only the average value is stored.

For example, the counter `cpu.usage.average` returns multiple values: one for each CPU core of an host.
The integration uses these values to compute the average, that is then included in the `VSphereHostSample` sample.

If you would like to send the metrics of each individual instance, you can use the flag `--consider_instances`. By enabling it, the integration will track the every fetched instance value and send them to separate extended samples such as `VSphereVMInstanceSample`. If a VM has 4 CPU cores, the integration will send 4 instance values and will store them under 4 rows under the `VSphereVMInstanceSample` sample. Beware, this corresponds to additional data ingest.

## Building

If you have downloaded the source code and installed the Go toolchain, you can build and run the vSphere integration locally.

vSphere data is obtained via a client provided by the `govmomi` package, the official Go wrapper for the VMware API. The same package provides a simulator for the virtual center, leveraged to run integration tests.

The output of the integration is determined by the `newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk` package and provided in JSON format. The [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent) collects such data and sends it to New Relic.

1. After cloning this repository, go to the vSphere integration directory and build the integration:

    ```bash
    make compile
    ```

    The command above executes the tests for the vSphere integration and builds an executable file named `nri-vsphere` under `bin/`.

2. Run the executable with the following arguments:

    ```bash
    ./bin/darwin/nri-vsphere --url 127.0.0.1:8989/sdk --user user --pass pass --validate_ssl false
    ```

To learn more about the usage of `./bin/darwin/nri-vsphere`, pass the `-help` argument.

```bash
./bin/darwin/nri-vsphere -help
```

External dependencies are managed via `govendor`.

## Testing

After cloning this repository, go to vSphere integration directory and build the integration:

```bash
make test
```

You need `docker-compose` to run the integration tests.

## Running the integration locally with a vCenter simulator

For testing purposes there is the possibility to run a docker compose cluster with 2 containers:
- One NewRelic Infrastructure agent with the integration installed.
- One container with [VCSIM](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/vcsim) running with the defaults to simulate a VCenter in port 8989.

This will emit VSphere metrics to NRONE based on the license key provided. 

A License Key (NRIA_LICENSE_KEY) env var must be provided.

You can also set the following env vars:
- STAGING   # To use a staging account 
- VS_HOSTS  # To set the number of simulated hosts per cluster (default: 1)
- VS_VMS    # To set the number of simulated Virtual Machines per resource pool (default: 10)
- VS_DS     # To set the number of simulated Data stores (default: 4)

Example:

```bash
NRIA_LICENSE_KEY=xxx make tools-vcsim-run
```

Example with hosts, vm, and ds custom:

```bash
NRIA_LICENSE_KEY=xxx VS_HOSTS=2 VS_VMS=20 VS_DS=10 make tools-vcsim-run
```

In order to stop the cluster you will need to run the following command:

```bash
make tools-vcsim-stop
```

## Support

Should you need assistance with New Relic products, you are in good hands with several support channels.


>New Relic offers NRDiag, [a client-side diagnostic utility](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) that automatically detects common problems with New Relic agents. If NRDiag detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. NRDiag can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. Remove this section if it doesn't apply.

If the issue has been confirmed as a bug or is a feature request, file a GitHub issue.
